Recently, I have started to collect data from GPS during bicycle commutes
using an Android smartphone. This job is done by [MyTracks url_mytracks].
I have tried other applications, but this one worked out best.

MyTracks, by default, creates a **kmz** file, which is a Keyhole
Markup Language (**kml**) file (or various) bundled with other resources
into a zip file. It can export to other types, but **kmz** has some
advantages, like photographs embedded on markers.

Loading this file in Google Maps directly from Google Drive was
straightforward, but it requires an internet connection. I wanted to view,
and maybe edit, the file offline.  I have tried loading the **kmz** file
directly on various applications under Linux, but the
I have only achieved getting the begin and end points this way.

So, I converted the **kmz** file to **gpx** (GPS Exchange Format) using
[gpsbabel url_gpsbabel] and the track was correctly imported (I am
using [JOSM - Java OpenStreetMap url_josm] on the computer).

== How to Convert ==

Given a **kmz** file, to get a **gpx** one:

{{code
$ unzip -p myfile.kmz doc.kml | gpsbabel -i kml -f - -o gpx -F myfile.gpx
code}}

``myfile.kmz`` is the file to be converted. gpsbabel does not convert
**kmz** directly to **gpx**, so it is necessary to extract the **kml**
file that inside **kmz** (which is ``doc.kml`` in the example). The file
is piped to gpsbabel which will save the new gpx file ``myfile.gpx``.
If there is more than one **kml** file, the processes must be
repeated for every kml.
