Booting Slackware may be slow compared to another operating systems.
This tutorial is based on Slackware 14.1.

== DHCP ==

Slackware waits for a DHCP response on boot. Look for the following lines

"""
{{code
echo "/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1:  /sbin/dhcpcd -t ${DHCP_TIMEOUT[$i]:-10} ${DHCP_OPTIONS} ${1}" | $LOGGER
/sbin/dhcpcd -t {$DHCP_TIMEOUT[$i]: -10 ${DHCP_OPTIONS} ${1}
code}}
"""

and just add a ``&`` on the end of the last line:

"""
{{code
echo "/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1:  /sbin/dhcpcd -t ${DHCP_TIMEOUT[$i]:-10} ${DHCP_OPTIONS} ${1}" | $LOGGER
/sbin/dhcpcd -t {$DHCP_TIMEOUT[$i]: -10 ${DHCP_OPTIONS} ${1} &
code}}
"""

== bzImage Loading ==

If the message:

"""
{{code
Loading Linux ..........
code}}
"""

takes too long, the solution can be adding the ``compact``
parameter on ``/etc/lilo.conf``:

"""
{{code
# Start LILO global section
# Append any additional kernel parameters:
append="vt.default_utf8=1 resume=/dev/sda7
boot = /dev/sda
compact
code}}
"""

Maybe there's already this parameter commented out, with
another comment saying it will be faster, but won't work
on all systems.

Don't forget to run the ``lilo`` command to modifications
take place:

"""
{{code
# lilo
code}}
"""
