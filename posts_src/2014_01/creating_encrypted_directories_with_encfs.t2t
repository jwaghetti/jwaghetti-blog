EncFS (Encrypted Filesystem) is a tool for encrypted filesystems in user space.
It does not require any special permissions, since it uses [FUSE extlink url_fuse].

Considering I will use encrypted folders mainly on things that need frequent backup,
the advantages are:

- per file encryption: will help on incremental backups;

- encrypted folder can grow: a great advantage against a loopback filesystem (like
[TrueCrypt extlink url_truecrypt], where you need to allocate resources before
using them;

- do not need root permissions: on every host there is FUSE support, I can use
EncFS and

- the configuration is straightforward.

-

I have used [eCryptfs extlink url_ecryptfs] before, but it does require
configuring `fstab` or having root privileges for mounting the encrypted folders.
The configuration is much more complicated.

== Configuration ==

First of all, make sure you have FUSE and EncFS installed on your system.

You will need a directory for the encrypted data to be stored and another
directory to mount the encrypted directory. For the example, let's call
the directories `encrypted` and `decrypted`, respectively. Both on the
home directory.

{{code
$ encfs ~/encrypted ~/decrypted
code}}

Notice that full paths are necessary. You will be prompted if you want
the preconfigured options or to configure it yourself. I choose the
defaults. At the end, you will be prompted for a password and confirmation.

To mount the encrypted folder again, the command is the same:

{{code
$ encfs /full/path/to/encrypted_folder /full/path/to/decrypted_folder
code}}

And to umount it:

{{code
$ fusermount -u /full/path/to/decrypted_folder
code}}
