Synergy is a program that allows two hosts
to share the keyboard and mouse of the
"server host" in ``X11``.

== Configuration ==

The following is an example config file, where server is
called ``serverhost`` and the client is called ``clienthost``.
The ``serverhost`` screen will be on left  of ``clienthost``.
Screensaver is synchronized on both screens.

{{code
section: options
    screenSaverSync = true
end
section: screens
    serverhost:
    clienthost:
end
section: links
    clienthost:
        left = serverhost
    serverhost:
        right = clienthost
end
code}}

= Sharing keyboard and mouse =

The server side must be initiated with

{{code
$ synergys -c config_file
code}}

Then, on client, you must run the ``synergyc``
specifying the server host

{{code
$ synergyc serverhost
code}}

== Firewall ==

The default port of Synergy is 24800. This port
needs to be open on server host firewall.
